The player takes on the role of the VOID IMP, a living sentient rabbit-shaped hole in the fabric of space. Its task, given to it by its Patron, is to seek out the Heart of the Matter. This is accomplished by exploring a vast monochrome world, gathering power, and defeating agents of Matter.

The VOID IMP is made up of the primordial substance known as Void, the polar opposite of Matter. It is capable of using the Void that constitutes its body and “drawing” it on the nearby environment. This forces material made out of generic Matter to react, usually by “phasing out,” allowing the solid to become intangible. It can also be “flicked” out quickly without having to stop to fully draw, allowing for quick shots of void that can be used to steadily carve through a thick wall of Matter or shoot down Matter-constitute creatures.

As one might expect, the introduction of Void to the universe will not go unchallenged by Matter. Creatures made of Matter will attempt to harm the VOID IMP and destroy it, hindering its process back to the last small rip of Void that it can return from. The most dangerous of these are the VOID IMP’s opposite number, the MATTER IMPs that patrol the different regions of the world and seek and destroy all Void they can find. Constructs of Matter are all over the place, including six Supports that protect the most powerful agents of Matter and possess the keys to finding the Heart.

The odds are against you. It’s you against the world.

Paint it blank.
